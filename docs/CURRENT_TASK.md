# Current Task

**Task:** Implement Aging and Life Stages integration

**Goal:** Integrate age-based behavioral effects and transitions for agents. Ensure agents progress through life stages (child, teen, adult, elder) and that life stage influences decision logic. Update or expand `update_life_stage()` in `sim/agents/agents.py` and connect with agent decision logic.

**Dependencies:**
- Main file: `sim/agents/agents.py`
- Related: agent decision logic modules
