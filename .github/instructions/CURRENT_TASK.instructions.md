# Policy: Always Update CURRENT_TASK.md

- Whenever the current development task changes, is completed, or a new task begins, immediately update `CURRENT_TASK.md` to reflect the active task.
- `CURRENT_TASK.md` must always contain only the single current active task, with a clear description or be empty.
- Remove completed tasks from `CURRENT_TASK.md` as soon as they are finished.
- Do not leave outdated or multiple tasks in `CURRENT_TASK.md`.
- This ensures all contributors have an up-to-date view of project focus.
