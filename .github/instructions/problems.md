# Problems Log

## Issue: Errors in `copilot-instructions.md`
- **Description**: The file contains duplicate keys (`description`, `name`) and unsupported attributes.
- **Details**:
  - Duplicate keys: `description` and `name` appear multiple times.
  - Unsupported attributes: Attributes like `- **Modular Simulation Engine**` are not valid.
  - These issues persist despite prior documentation.
- **Impact**: These issues prevent the file from being parsed correctly.
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Remove duplicate keys.
  2. Replace unsupported attributes with valid ones.
  3. Validate the file structure after corrections.
- **Review Schedule**: Periodically check if these issues have become more tractable due to other development progress.
