In this example, the city's systems are represented as a hierarchical structure with two main categories: Government Locations and Private Locations. Each location has a description, features, interactions with other locations, and dependencies on other locations.

**Government Locations**

* City Hall: The central hub of the city's government, responsible for administration, laws, and public services.
* Town Hall: A local government office responsible for public services and community programs.
* Police Department: A law enforcement agency responsible for maintaining public safety.

**Private Locations**

* Train Station: A transportation hub connecting the city to other cities and regions.
* Bus Depot: A transportation hub connecting the city to other cities and regions.
* Hospital: A medical facility providing emergency and non-emergency care.

Each location has its own set of features, such as buildings, public areas, and support services. Interactions between locations are represented as connections between locations, with descriptions of how citizens or officials can access one location from another. Dependencies between locations are represented as relationships between locations, with descriptions of how one location relies on another for operation.

This hierarchical structure allows for easy navigation and understanding of the city's systems, making it easier to identify relationships between locations and dependencies that need to be managed.
