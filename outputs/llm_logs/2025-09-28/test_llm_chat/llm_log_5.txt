LLM: **Description of Hammer**

A hammer is a versatile hand tool used for pounding, shaping, breaking, and tapping various materials. It consists of a handle attached to a heavy head, typically made of metal, which serves as the striking surface.

**Physical Properties:**

* **Handle:** A long, cylindrical or contoured extension of the tool, typically made of wood, fiberglass, or steel, designed for comfortable grip and control.
* **Head:** The striking surface, usually made of metal (e.g., steel, titanium), with a flat or curved face, and a rounded or pointed end.
* **Weight:** The total weight of the hammer, including the head and handle, which can range from a few ounces to several pounds.
* **Length:** The overall length of the hammer, including the handle and head, which can vary from a few inches to over two feet.

**Functional Properties:**

* **Striking Surface:** The flat or curved face of the head, designed for delivering controlled blows to various materials.
* **Impact Force:** The amount of force applied to the striking surface, which can be adjusted by varying the swing speed and technique.
* **Angle of Impact:** The angle at which the hammer strikes the target material, influencing the effectiveness of the blow.

**Affordances:**

* **Pounding:** The ability to deliver a controlled, repeated impact to drive nails or shape materials.
* **Breaking:** The capacity to apply sufficient force to break or shatter objects, such as rocks or ice.
* **Tapping:** The gentle, precise striking motion used for tapping parts into place or shaping delicate materials.
* **Shaping:** The ability to use the hammer's striking surface to shape and form various materials, such as metal, wood, or stone.

**Sensory Properties:**

* **Visual:** The hammer's appearance, including its color, material, and design features.
* **Tactile:** The feel of the handle in the hand, the weight and balance of the tool, and the sound of the striking surface impacting a target.
* **Auditory:** The sound produced when the hammer strikes a surface, which can be loud or muted depending on the material and impact force.

**Behavioral Properties:**

* **Usage:** The various tasks for which the hammer is suited, including construction, repair, crafting, and demolition.
* **Handling:** The techniques and skills required to effectively use the hammer, such as grip, stance, and swing motion.
* **Maintenance:** The care and maintenance required to keep the hammer in good condition, including cleaning, storage, and replacement of worn or damaged parts.

2. **Handling:** Grip, stance, swing motion, and control techniques for effective use.
3. **Maintenance:** Cleaning, storage, replacement of worn or damaged parts.

**Causal Relationships:**

* Weight distribution affects balance and control during use.
* Striking surface characteristics influence the effectiveness of pounding, breaking, tapping, and shaping.
* Impact force and angle of impact determine the outcome of striking a surface (e.g., driving a nail vs. shattering an object).
* Material hardness affects the durability and performance of the hammer.

**Scenarios:**

1. **Driving nails:** Pounding with a 16-ounce hammer (60% head, 40% handle) on a wooden beam.
2. **Breaking rocks:** Using a 32-ounce hammer (80% head, 20% handle) to shatter a rock for construction purposes.
3. **Tapping parts:** Gently tapping a metal part into place with a 12-ounce hammer (50% head, 50% handle).
4. **Shaping metal:** Using a curved-faced hammer to shape a metal sheet for crafting purposes.
