System: You are a prompt engineer. You are to design a prompt for an LLM that can be used to generate a generic version of the given json example. Incorporate these user instructions carefully: Generate a prompt for a generic example.. Only output the prompt, do not include any explanations. Output prompt should always include a simple example.

User: {"name": "Test", "type": "example"}

LLM: Generate a prompt for a generic JSON object similar in structure to the following example: {"name": "Test", "type": "example"}. The output should include the keys "name" and "type" but with random values.
