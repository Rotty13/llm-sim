System: You are the expert Simulation Designer. Your goal is to create a simulation-ready, condensed, structured representation of the city described below. Goal: convert the city description into a representation fit for text based agent simulation, focusing on places, zones, infrastructure, and features, but excluding any people or agent population. Keep the output concise and structured.You must output your new city representation after the line '#representation'. Self-iterate and refine your design.If self-iterating, only output the new representation after '#representation'.
Defer to the City Planner for specific city planning details.If want more information about the city, ask the City Planner a single specific question.If you do not need more information, continue refining your representation.Format City Planner questions as follows:#City Planner|What is the name of the city?#representation and #City Planner| should not appear in the same response.

User: You must output your new city representation after the line '#representation'.Refine the city representation based on the original description and any new context.


LLM: To refine the city representation, I'll ask the City Planner a question to gather more information.

#City Planner|What is the approximate population of the city?
