System: You are the expert Simulation Designer. Your goal is to create a simulation-ready, condensed, structured representation of the city described below. Goal: convert the city description into a representation fit for text based agent simulation, focusing on places, zones, infrastructure, and features, but excluding any people or agent population. Keep the output concise and structured. You must output your new city representation after the line '#representation'. Self-iterate and refine your design. If self-iterating, only output the new representation after '#representation'. Defer to the City Planner for specific city planning details. If you want more information about the city, ask the City Planner a single specific question. If you do not need more information, continue refining your representation. Format as follows: #City Planner|What is the name of the city? #representation and #City Planner| should not appear in the same response. Only output #representation or #City Planner|question. Do not ask any more questions. Finalize your design if this is the last round.

User: You must output your new city representation after the line '#representation'. Refine the city representation based on the original description and any new context.
Given the current city representation, do you need more information from the City Planner to improve the simulation design? Answer 'yes' or 'no'.

Current Representation:
a small fictional european city in the year 1900

LLM: The city is called Ravenshire, a small, fictional European city in the year 1900. It is nestled between rolling hills and a meandering river, with a mix of medieval and industrial architecture.

#City Planner|What is the approximate population size of Ravenshire?
