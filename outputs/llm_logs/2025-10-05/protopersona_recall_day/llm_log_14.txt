LLM: Mon dieu... what a day it has been! I'm still feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the memories flooding back. But if I had to pick a few highlights, I'd say it was seeing Sophie finally grasp the concept of fractions, and watching her face light up with understanding. It's moments like those that make teaching so rewarding.

I also loved sharing the news with Madame Lebrun about Léon's progress in math class. She's such a kind soul, and I know how much she cares about her students. It's always a pleasure to be able to share good news with her.

And of course, planning the field trip to the children's museum with my students was a blast! They're so full of energy and excitement, it's infectious. I'm really looking forward to taking them on that adventure.

But what really made my day was talking to my sister on the phone. She's coming to visit from Paris, and I couldn't be more excited to see her. We haven't seen each other in ages, and I know we'll have a wonderful time catching up and reminiscing about old times.

And as for the rest... well, it's just been a day of reflecting on my life and my goals. Teaching is such a

How do you feel about your memories?

LLM: Mes souvenirs! *laughs* My memories are like a treasure trove for me. I cherish every moment I've had with my students, watching them grow and learn. It's a privilege to be a part of their educational journey, and I feel so grateful to have such a rewarding career.

I must say, it's not just the big moments that stick with me, but also the small, everyday interactions with my students. Like when a child finally understands a concept they've been struggling with, or when they share a personal story with me. Those moments make teaching so worthwhile.

And, of course, memories of my family are always dear to me. My sister's visit is going to be a lovely break from the daily routine, and I'm looking forward to reconnecting with her.

But what really gets me thinking about my life and goals is when I reflect on the school itself. I wish we had better resources and facilities for our students. It would make such a big difference in their learning experience. Maybe one day, I'll be able to help make that happen... *smiles wistfully*
