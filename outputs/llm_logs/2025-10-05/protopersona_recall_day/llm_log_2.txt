Recall your day. Output 'Recall(subject/event/fact)'.

LLM: Recall(start of the day)
I woke up early, before sunrise, to start my day at The Forge. I've been working here for years, and it's become a routine I enjoy.

Recall(task 1: morning preparations)
I began by checking the fire pit and adding more coal to get the forge hot. I also made sure my tools were in order and my apron was clean.

Recall(task 2: hammering hot metal)
Once the forge was hot, I started working on a new piece of armor for one of the local knights. It's a big job, but I'm confident in my skills. My hands moved quickly and precisely as I hammered the hot metal into shape.

Recall(lunch break)
After a few hours of work, I took a short break to eat some bread and cheese. My wife, Colette, had packed me a lunch, and it was a welcome respite from the heat of the forge.

Recall(task 3: repairing tools)
In the afternoon, I spent some time repairing a broken plow for one of the local farmers. It's not the most exciting job, but it's important work that helps people in our community.

Recall(end of the day)

LLM: I remember the crack of dawn on a sweltering summer morning like it was yesterday. The sun had barely risen over the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over The Forge, our humble blacksmith shop. I, Auguste Dumont, stood outside the entrance, taking a deep breath of the crisp morning air, feeling the dew-kissed grass beneath my feet.

As I stretched my arms above my head, the familiar creak of the wooden sign above the door echoed through the stillness. The Forge, emblazoned in bold letters, seemed to stretch out like a promise, a reminder of the hard work that lay ahead. My strong hands, calloused from years of hammering hot metal, flexed involuntarily as I yawned, feeling the familiar ache in my back from last night's labor.

I glanced over at the small cottage adjacent to the shop, where my wife, Colette, was already stirring the breakfast pot. The aroma of freshly baked bread and simmering coffee wafted out, mingling with the scent of hot metal and sweat that clung to me like a second skin. My stomach growled in anticipation as I made my way towards the cottage, eager to fuel up for the long day ahead.

Recall your day.

LLM: What a lovely start to the day! As I walked towards the cottage, the warm sunlight on my face and the sound of Colette's humming in the kitchen lifted my spirits. We exchanged a brief but loving greeting, and I took a seat at the table, where a hearty breakfast was waiting for me.

Colette had prepared a delicious spread of eggs, sausage, and freshly baked bread, accompanied by a steaming cup of coffee. I dug in with gusto, savoring the flavors and textures as we chatted about our plans for the day. My children, Jacques and Sophie, were still sleeping, but I knew they'd be up soon, eager to start their own day.

After breakfast, I headed back to The Forge, where my apprentice, Pierre, was already waiting for me. We spent the morning working on a new commission, a set of horseshoes for the local stable owner. The work was physically demanding, but I enjoyed the challenge of shaping and tempering the hot metal. Pierre was a quick learner, and I was proud to see him develop his skills under my guidance.

As the morning wore on, the shop grew busier, with customers arriving to collect their orders or place new ones. I worked tirelessly, hammering away at the
